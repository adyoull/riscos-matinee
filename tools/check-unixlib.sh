# later (the thread timer that can run from the PThreadTicker module), and
# a program with FFmpeg's file protocol with UnixLib 5.0.2's files over
# 2GB: its libavformat built against 5.0.2's headers calls
# __unixlib_fstat64 (the 64-bit st_size), not the old fstat64.
#
# UnixLib 5.0.1's start-up code claims a 472-byte pthread block in the RMA
# (the ticker code and its counters); the Warzone toolchain's earlier
# UnixLib claimed 248, GCCSDK's own 120. A program linked with the wrong
# library would still run, but without the fixes the apps' !Run files load
# PThreadTicker for. Same test as riscos-unixlib's tools/check-lib.sh:
# the "mov r3, #<size>" before OS_Module 6 in no_dynamic_area.
# Run by build/package.sh on every program it packages.
